As an undergraduate student of IIT Hyderabad, I have significant background in Software development. I held multiple internships, including Software Engineering Intern at Aerospike where I built a Monitoring System in Golang. I have also worked as React Developer for an early stage startup to develop complete Front-End functionality in React and Redux. Apart from these I have worked on several projects in Data Analysis and Machine Learning. 

Also worked as Manager for Elan & Nvision IIT Hyderabad (cultural and technical fest of IIT Hyderabad) and E-Cell (Entrepreneurship Cell) IIT Hyderabad. I like to explore and try out various things and so in turn learn a lot of things.

These strengths, combined with deep and varied academic, internship, and employment experience, prepare me to make a strong and immediate impact at SAP.
I am excited about the opportunity to join SAP team. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.
